## Project Description
The AI Anomaly Detection Model aims to identify unusual patterns that may indicate security breaches or vulnerabilities. This model is particularly useful for detecting zero-day vulnerabilities, malicious activities, and other security threats in a proactive manner.

## Features
- **Real-time Anomaly Detection:** Continuously monitors data streams to detect anomalies in real-time.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for accurate anomaly detection.
- **Scalable and Flexible:** Easily scalable to handle large volumes of data and adaptable to various cybersecurity use cases.
- **User-friendly Interface:** Provides an intuitive interface for monitoring and managing detected anomalies.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-anomaly-detection.git
   cd ai-anomaly-detection
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset and place it in the `data` directory.
2. Configure the model parameters as described in the [Configuration](#configuration) section.
3. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
4. Evaluate the model:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```
5. Use the model for anomaly detection:
   ```bash
   python detect.py
   ```

## Configuration
Configure the model parameters and settings in the `config.json` file. This includes settings for data preprocessing, model architecture, training parameters, and evaluation metrics.

Example `config.json`:
```json
{
  "data_path": "data/",
  "model": {
    "type": "LSTM",
    "layers": 3,
    "units": 128,
